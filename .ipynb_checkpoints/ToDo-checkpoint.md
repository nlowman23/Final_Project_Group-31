PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Notebook structure
It is best to think about your final project as a data-driven report. You will need to put everything into a Jupyter notebook with the following structure:

Introduction: Introduce the project, and your approach, talk about the process of how you came up with the metric and some alternatives you may have explored.
The Metric: Describe your metric, and what features are you measuring. What datasets are you using?
The Best Neighborhood: Apply the metric from the previous section to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Beyond just executing code, provide a narrative about why you think this is the best neighborhood. Incorporate a data visualization, perhaps to rank all of the neighborhoods or show a neighborhood’s best-ness over time. The key is to make a data driven argument.
Conclusion: Reflect on how the data-driven determination of “best neighborhood” is the same or different from your personal favorite neighborhood. Each member of the group should write their own response to this.

Each group member should be able to talk about their metric and what data they're using to measure it. You should describe what conclusions you came to on your own. Then, your group should describe how you combined your metrics, and state which neighborhood was the best according to your combined metric.

After you present, you will open up the floor for questions from your UTA and your fellow classmates. Part of your grade depends on giving satisfactory answers to your student questions. Additionally, you need to ask at least one other group a question at some point during these two lectures.
