PRESENTATION DESCRIPTION
Each group member should be able to talk about their metric and what data they're using to measure it. You should describe what conclusions you came to on your own. Then, your group should describe how you combined your metrics, and state which neighborhood was the best according to your combined metric.

After you present, you will open up the floor for questions from your UTA and your fellow classmates. Part of your grade depends on giving satisfactory answers to your student questions. Additionally, you need to ask at least one other group a question at some point during these two lectures.
