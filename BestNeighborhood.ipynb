    "- Introduction: Introduce the project, and your approach, talk about the process of how you came up with the metric and some alternatives you may have explored.\n",
    "- The Metric: Describe your metric, and what features are you measuring. What datasets are you using?\n",
    "- The Best Neighborhood: Apply the metric from the previous section to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Beyond just executing code, provide a narrative about why you think this is the best neighborhood. Incorporate a data visualization, perhaps to rank all of the neighborhoods or show a neighborhood’s best-ness over time. The key is to make a data driven argument.\n",
    "- Conclusion: Reflect on how the data-driven determination of “best neighborhood” is the same or different from your personal favorite neighborhood. Each member of the group should write their own response to this."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this presentation, we will be determining the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. More specifically, we will be judging the neighborhoods baseed on the quality of public services that the neighborhood provides to its residents. Our goal is to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on the overall quality and quantity of public services that it provides to its residents. We decided on this metric by getting a list of all of the data sets that we could find that we were willing to use, and then selected quality of public services because it matched up well with the data sets we were most hoping to use.\n",

    "While our main metric is quality of public services, that leaves a lot of room for interpretation. The exact public services we are using are: the amount of parks in the neighborhood, the public facilities located within the neighborhood, and the quality of education within the neighborhood. This data comes from the following CSVs: 'City Facilities', [ LENNY AND NATE PUT SOMETHING HERE] \n",
    "\n",
    "We combined our metrics by considering the top neighborhoods from each of our individual data sets. We want a neighborhood that is a jack of all trades and provides a lot of different servies to its residents, and not a neighborhood that is neccessarily the best in every category. The main [CONTINUE LATER]\n",
    "\n",
    "The first metric we will be looking at is the facilities located within each neighborhood. If you remember, the best neighborhood was determined to be Brookline, but with [other neighborhoods] doing good as well. In case you want a referesher, here are all the neighborhoods with more than 10 public facilities available to its residents."
