OLD readme below
We are arguing that the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh is one that provides the best services to its residence. To determine the best neighborhood, we are judging every neighborhood based on 3 categories: the amount of public facilities each neighborhood has, the amount of parks each neighborhood has, and the quality of education in each neighborhood.
